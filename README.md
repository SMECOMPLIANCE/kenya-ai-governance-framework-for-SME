# Project AIDA: An Open-Source AI Governance Framework for Kenyan SMEs

**Empowering Kenyan SMEs to adopt AI responsibly while ensuring compliance with Kenya's Data Protection Act, 2019.**

---

## The Problem

Kenyan Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are rapidly adopting AI-powered tools such as WhatsApp chatbots and automated customer service bots to grow their businesses. However, this comes with significant compliance challenges:

- **Knowledge Gap:** Most SME owners lack expertise in tech law and do not understand critical concepts like "lawful basis for processing" or "data protection by design."
- **Resource Scarcity:** Legal advice and compliance audits are prohibitively expensive, often costing tens of thousands of Kenyan shillings per hour beyond the reach of typical SMEs.
- **Tooling Mismatch:** Existing compliance solutions target large corporations and are ill-suited to the unique needs and scale of SMEs.
- **Enforcement Reality:** The Office of the Data Protection Commissioner (ODPC) in Kenya actively enforces the Data Protection Act, 2019, with penalties up to KES 5 million or 1% of annual turnover posing existential risks for SMEs unaware of their compliance obligations.

## The Solution

**Project AIDA** offers a pragmatic, accessible, and free governance framework tailored specifically for Kenyan SMEs using AI. It includes:

- **The White Paper:** A concise, analytical document that explains the legal context, outlines the compliance challenge, and presents a clear, actionable AI governance framework.
- **The Practical Toolkit:** Ready-to-use templates including:
  - AI-centric Privacy Policy  
  - Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) form  
  - Record of Processing Activities (RoPA) spreadsheet  
  - AI Risk Checklist  

These resources demystify compliance, close the knowledge gap, reduce reliance on costly legal services, and enable SMEs to demonstrate a good-faith effort to comply with the Data Protection Act.
